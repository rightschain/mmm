		 <h1>Introduction</h1>       
                
<p>The foundation of the future digital music business is data. The ideal being a federated system of interoperable datasets, in which each stakeholder in the system communicates authoritative, normalized data to other participants in the system with minimal human intervention required. The current state of music data is far from that ideal, as the different vertical systems are not interoperable, and the data at individual organisations within those verticals is rife with errors, and ambiguity. To make matters more complicated, organisation also operate at very different levels of technology adoption, and the industry has been incredibly slow in dealing with these challenges. </p>

            <p>RightsChain is supporting a service that leverages the power of emerging technologies (such as the blockchain ledger) to create a standard set of "metadata gauges" for the industry to operate on at all levels of sophistication. It provides control to the owners, and transparency to all stakeholders were required.
            </p>
<p>The problems resolved by the these emerging technologies are dependent on the underlying music datasets, and what is required for each stakeholder. Establishing manageable metadata sets that are both backwards-compatible and forward-looking are equally critical in order to address the industry needs. </p>

<p>
The amount of metadata that can be associated with musical works or master recordings is endless. However, MMM is concerned with the essential functions of identifying the original and current owner(s) of a composition or master, and to match of the correct master to the correct composition. MMM defines and establishes sufficient requirements for data exchange to enable unambiguous identification of entities and their relationships </p>

		 <h1>Music Metadata Model (MMM)</h1>
            
          
            
          <p>The MMM logical View describes the details of the key entities and their relationships as shown in Figure 1 below. The Data Model uses the principles from the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records [[IFLA-FRBR]] to consistently describe the relationships between these core entities, specifically:</p>
           
           <ul>
             <li>A Composition (Work) is realised through</li>
               <li>a Recording (Expression), which is embodied in</li>
               <li>a Media (Manifestation) resource, which are exemplified by</li>
               <li>a License to use a Media Asset instance (Item).</li>
           
           </ul>
            <p>Note that an Album is a curated compilation of Recordings and that Parties will play a role in almost all the entities.</p>
            <figure>
          	<img src="model.png" alt="MMM Logical View" width="800"/>
            <figcaption>MMM Logical View</figcaption>
       </figure>
           
        <p>The MMM package MAY contain any or all of the shown entities and relationships.
      
      As an absolute base-line, some entities will require minimal properties, specifically for the Composition and Recording entities, which are their titles and at least one party. This level of metadata would be considered the minimum to register in a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) service. The more properties supplied by the claimant (for all the entities), the better the overall quality as matching entities, and detecting conflicts will improve. This additional level of metadata would be comprised of the most commonly used datasets for commercialization, curated from multiple sources such as music distributors, labels, performing rights organizations, collecting societies, and music publishers.</p>
          
           <p>The expected use of the MMM package is to allow for interested parties to submit data about entities of interest. MMM will follow the Verifiable Claims Data Model [[W3C-CLAIM]] developed by the W3C Credentials Community Group to allow MMM packages to be to be asserted and processed as claims. Interested Parties (the claimants) make these claims and are processed by the DLT service to produce aggregate data about these entities. The aggregate data is further processed for similarity and conflict. Mentioned parties are also verified (where applicable) and can also provide direct responses (such as approve or deny) to improve the data quality of the MMM claims.</p>
           
           <p>All the data in the MMM Package is assumed to be public, that is, any person can see it. If there is data that is confidential then that can still be expressed in the MMM Package for those with the correct credentials to access only. The mechanism for this encryption is described in the <a href="#technical">Technical Architecture section</a>.</p>
 
            <p>There are existing metadata style guides and practices in the industry. Relevant MMM property values MUST follow the Music Metadata Style Guide [[!MBA-STYLE]]. For example, the titles of compositions and recordings may include parenthetical markers, and these should be stripped when matching values.</p>
            
        <section id="provenance">
		 <h3>Provenance</h3>
            
        <p>Provenance data allows for the MMM Package to express its origin to support when and who has made the claim. The who is important as this may influence the processing of conflicts and authority levels for trust.</p>

        <p>The MMM properties for Provenance include:</p> 
           <div class="example">
               <ul>
                 <li><b>Date</b> - the date (and time) the claim was made. This property is REQUIRED.</li>
                 <li><b>Claimant</b> - the identifier of the <code>authorised user</code> who is making the claim. This property is REQUIRED. The Claimant may be an Agent of, or an interested Party in the claim.</li>

          </div>      
        </section>
        
    <section id="party">
		 <h3>Party</h3>
            
        <p>Party data allows for the MMM Package to express the interested parties in the Entity. The Party entity is used extensively in other creative entities (such as Composition and Recording). There are a number of properties in describing the Party with links to Professional Rights Organisations that can provide verification services.</p>

        <p>The MMM properties for Party include:</p> 
           <div class="example">
                       <ul>
                     <li><b>Name</b> - the professional name of the Party. This property can either be a text field or the code for an <code>authorised user</code>. If it is the latter, the Party is a known user of the DLT service.  This property is REQUIRED.</li>
                    <li><b>Identifier</b> - a formal identifier of the Party. This property MUST use the International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) to identify parties [[!ISO27729]]</li>
                    <li><b>Role</b> - what role was played in the creation of the entity. Terms from the CISAC Works Role vocabulary [[!CISAC-TABLE]] MUST be used for a Composition.</li>
                      <li><b>Share</b> - what percentage share the Party is claiming (or allocated) of the Entity. If there are multiple Parties in the MMM Package, then the total MUST not exceed 100%.</li>
                      <li><b>PRO</b> - the name of the Professional Rights Organisation (PRO) that represents the Party. This property can either be a text field or the code for an <code>authorised user</code>. If it is the latter, the PRO is a known user of the DLT service.</li>
                      <li><b>IPI</b> - the IPI (Interested Party Identifier) used by the PRO to identify this Party. This property MUST only appear if there is a PRO property.</li>
                       <li><b>Contact</b> - contact information about the Party, such as email and physical address. This field can either by text, or if structured data is provided, it MUST conform to the W3C vCard Ontology [[!VCARD-RDF]]. Note that this information MAY also be provided by the PRO during the verification of the IPI (and is strongly encouraged).</li>
                        <li><b>Payment</b> -  information about how to pay the Party, for purposes such as royalty payments. This field can either by text, or if structured data is provided, it MUST conform to the Financial Industry Business Ontology [[!FIBO]].

		 <h1>MMM - Examples</h1>
           
    <p>The normative encoding for MMM is JSON-LD [[!JSON-LD]] to support both JSON serialisation environments and to enable Linked Data web services. JSON-LD also supports I18N with the ability to tag human-readable strings with language maps defined by [[!BCP47]].</p>
        
          <div class="issue" >
            <p>These examples - both technically and semantically - are all fictional. They are used to provide illustrative examples only and maybe inconsistent.</p>
          </div>
        
        <p>The Type and Identifier properties are mapped to @type and @id in JSON-LD.</p>
        <p>In all cases, use of @id to uniquely identify the object is RECOMMENDED.</p>

     <h2>Composition</h2>
        
        <p>The example below shows a simple Composition MMM Package from SOCAN (PRO). Each interested party is identified with SOCAN IPIs in the <b>@id</b> and hence can be fully verified (and all other info about them can be accessed - eg contact info etc).</p>

     <h2>Recording of Composition</h2>
        
<p>The example below shows a Recording MMM Package from an independent label. The Recording is based on the above Composition (same ISWC in the realisationOf).  In this case, each interested party fully supplies their contact and banking information (and cannot be verified by an external source). The contact info uses the vCard ontology (we also @type the party with multiple types) and the bank information uses the FIBO ontology. Also part of the MMM Package is the Media associated with this recording (the mp3 master).</p>

<h1>MMM - Change Request</h1>

    <p>A fundamental function of a DLT service is the ability for Parties to make counter-claims over an existing  MMM package. These may be as simple as (important) data errors (such as the incorrect release date) or challenges to significant roles (such as who was the Lead Producer and Share distributions).</p>
  
    <p>A Change Request will indicate the source @id of the original MMM Package and MUST only include the specified properties that are the subject of the change. The Change Request MUST include the @id of any contained objects.</p>
    
     <p>There are three main Change Request types:</p> 
        
    <div class="example">
     <ul>
         <li><b>Add</b> - the properties MAY be added to the MMM Package (and MUST not  already exist in the original MMM Package).</li>
        <li><b>Remove</b> - the properties MAY be removed from the MMM Package (and MUST  already exist in the original MMM Package).</li>
       <li><b>Update</b> - the properties MAY update existing properties in the MMM Package (and MUST   already exist in the original MMM Package).</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

     <p>Note: This specification cover the expression of a Change Request but does not include details on how the Change Request is processed (such as the determination of consensus amongst multiple Parties).</p>
